This is a Next.js app that provides APR and points data for Yearn vaults on Katana via API endpoints. It is designed for serverless deployment (e.g., Vercel).

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or yarn dev / pnpm dev / bun dev
```

### API Endpoints

- **GET `/api/health`** — Health check endpoint.

All API routes are defined in `src/app/api/`.

#### Example Usage

curl http://localhost:3000/api/katana-apr
```

Response:

{
  "vaults": [
    // ...vault APR data
  ]
}
